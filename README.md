# Brainstorm Press (API)

Brainstorm Press is a blogging platform with payments enabled by Bitcoin and the Lightning Network.

The Brainstorm Press API is built with Node, Express, and TypeScript. The database is a MongoDB Atlas cluster, managed mostly through [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/). Lightning invoice statuses are communicated to the client via WebSockets.
